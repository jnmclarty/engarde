Installation and Dependencies
=============================

Engarde itself is pure python, so I'd just use ``pip``::

    pip install engarde

It does depend on ``pandas``, which may be more difficult to pip
install. You might consider [conda_] if you have trouble installing
pandas and its dependencies. Once you have the dependencies sorted out
a ``pip install engarde`` should work.
